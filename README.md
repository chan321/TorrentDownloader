# TorrentDownloader
Made the ui of the downloader using Qt Designer.<br>
Made by PyQt based on Qt4 using PyCharm 2017.3 Community Edition Editor<br>
Used Python 3.4 to build it<br>
The content is being scrapped from https://zooqle.com<br>
All the codes in Implement.py is written with comments where needed<br>

Download feature has not been build.I tried building download feature using seedr.cc website and splinter
library but it has google captcha installed.

Further development has been stopped till I find the favourable condition.

<b>NOTICE<b><br>
It has been build to download freeware from torrent and keep the amazing concept of torrent going.<br>
I encourage the users to build it in a way that is recommended.<br>
I don't take responsibility if it is used in a way not recommended
